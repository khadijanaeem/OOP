/*
Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which every number after the first two is the sum of the two
preceding ones. Write a C++ program that takes a number n from user and populate a dynamic
array with first n Fibonacci numbers.
For example:
For n=10
Fibonacci Numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55*/
